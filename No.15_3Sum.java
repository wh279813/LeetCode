 * For this question, even solution by brute-force algorithm can also be accecpted with a time complexity O(n^2).
 * Here we get a better way -- sort the arrary, set the header pointer and tail pointer.
 * If the sum is larger than target, move tail pointer(so the sum would become smaller). 
 * Otherwise move header pointer.
